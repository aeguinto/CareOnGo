		Diabetes is a type of chronic disease that can cause severe complications and even death. It is very important for us to recognize the signs of diabetes and how to deal with it so we can control it early. Moreover, diabetes does not only attack old people, many young people suffer from this disease and experience serious complications.
		
		Signs of Diabetes
		Diabetes itself occurs due to high levels of sugar or glucose in the blood. Normally glucose is used as the main energy source for the body. However, diabetics cannot use glucose as an energy source and ultimately glucose will accumulate in the body. Following are some signs that indicate that someone is suffering from diabetes.

		1. Easier to get thirsty and hungry
		People who suffer from diabetes usually feel thirsty and hungry easily. Most diabetes sufferers will experience a dry mouth sensation so it is not surprising if they are always thirsty. Meanwhile, they also cannot use glucose as an energy source so they will always feel hungry.
		
		2. Frequent urination
		Another symptom experienced by diabetes sufferers is frequent urination. This is caused by the body's inability to absorb glucose. In the end, the kidneys have to work hard to remove glucose from the body. This condition then triggers an increase in the frequency of urination.
		
		3. Decreased Muscle Mass
		Diabetics also usually experience a drastic reduction in muscle mass and body weight. This happens because the body cannot use sugar as energy so the body breaks down fat to meet energy needs. This process of breaking down fat then causes muscle mass to decrease and body weight to drop drastically.
		
		4. The body easily becomes weak
		Glucose stored by the body cannot be processed into an energy source. So it is not surprising that people who have diabetes will feel weak more easily. Even though you have eaten a lot, your body will still feel weak and not enthusiastic about doing activities.
		
		5. Wounds Difficult to Heal
		When wounds appear, diabetes sufferers cannot experience a fast healing process. This is caused by high levels of sugar in the blood which will prevent the body from fighting bacteria. In fact, wounds can become worse and become infected due to this condition.
		
		6. Suffer from infections easily
		Related to the previous point, diabetes sufferers usually experience infections more easily. So it is not surprising that people who have diabetes usually get sick more easily. This is caused by decreased body resistance along with high blood sugar levels. In fact, this infection can trigger various types of complications that are deadly for the patient.
		
		How to Treat Diabetes
		What can diabetes patients do to recover? Diabetes is a chronic disease that cannot be completely cured. Sufferers of this disease can only minimize the side effects or risk of complications from diabetes itself. The following are several things that diabetes sufferers can do to maintain their body condition.

		1. Adjust your diet
		The most important thing that diabetes sufferers must do is regulate their diet. A healthy diet will help diabetes sufferers maintain a stable body condition. If you are diagnosed with diabetes, then make a commitment to maintaining a healthy diet.

		The principle is easy, make sure not to eat too much sweet food because it can increase blood sugar levels. Apart from that, avoid refined carbohydrates such as white bread and white rice. It's better to choose types of carbohydrates in the form of brown rice and whole wheat bread.

		2. Exercise regularly
		Diet and exercise to treat diabetes must be done in a balanced manner. After arranging a healthy eating pattern, you must commit to exercising regularly. Exercise will help the body's metabolism run more smoothly and can control blood sugar levels.

		Choose a type of exercise that is fun according to your body's abilities. Make sure you can do these sports activities regularly so that they provide optimal benefits for the body.

		3. Control blood sugar
		Diabetics must continue to monitor their blood sugar condition. The only way to avoid complications in diabetes patients is to control blood sugar levels well. So as much as possible check your blood sugar levels and make sure they are always stable. If your blood sugar levels increase sharply, you can immediately make efforts to return them to normal levels.

		4. Take medication according to the doctor's instructions
		If your condition requires taking medication, then do it according to your doctor's instructions. Under certain conditions, diabetes sufferers must take regular medication. This is usually done if blood sugar levels are difficult to control only with a healthy lifestyle.

		Make sure to take medication that is prescribed by a doctor. Medication consumption must also be done regularly every day to help

			"The stomach feels sore, nausea and stomach acid rise through the throat, among other things, are symptoms of stomach ulcers. Prevent..",
		content: `
		5 out of 10 workers of productive age in Indonesia have had stomach ulcers, whether only occasionally or if it has become a chronic or acute disease. Ulcer disease cannot be considered trivial, because it can have serious consequences if not treated properly.


		What are the preventive measures and how to treat stomach ulcers?

		Symptoms of stomach ulcers
		Ulcer disease is caused by stomach acid rising through the esophagus. Human stomach acid has a pH of between 1.5 and 3.5, which is very acidic because it is used to digest food - so stomach acid that rises again will cause a burning sensation and irritation in the throat and stomach. The mouth feels sour, chokes, nausea and chest pain - these symptoms are called "heartburn" in English. This uncomfortable condition can last for several hours each time it occurs.

		How to quickly deal with stomach acid
		There are many natural ways to treat ulcers. Start by standing, assume an upright posture and loosen your belt or pants tight enough so that they are not tight. Mix a glass of water with a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, or if you don't have apple cider vinegar, use a mixture of warm water and baking soda to neutralize stomach acidity. If possible, always provide generic antacid drugs that can be purchased anywhere.

		How to cure stomach acid in the long term
		Ulcer and stomach acid problems are often caused by an unhealthy lifestyle and eating patterns, so changing habits for the better can play a big role in curing stomach acid in the long term.

		Although the main causes of ulcers can vary between sufferers, there are certain types of food and drinks that can cause them. Foods that are high in fat, such as foods made with coconut milk and various fried foods, which are actually soaked in hot oil, contain a lot of trans fat and have the risk of causing ulcer symptoms to recur due to increased stomach acid. Apart from that, spicy foods such as chili sauce and drinks containing caffeine and soda can also cause ulcers.

		Meanwhile, lifestyles that can cause stomach acid to recur include: eating too often late, smoking and drinking too much alcohol, eating too much and going to bed too quickly after eating (experts recommend eating at least two to three hours before bed), excess weight gain, lack of sleep and too much stress.

		content: `
		What is GERD?
		GERD is a condition that occurs when stomach acid flows back (acid reflux) into the esophagus, which is the connecting channel between the mouth and the stomach. Acid reflux is actually normal, but if it occurs repeatedly, it will trigger GERD. The result is irritation of the esophageal lining.

		You can try to detect gastric acid disease or GERD as early as possible from the symptoms it causes. When someone suffers from GERD, common symptoms include a burning sensation in the pit of the stomach or heartburn, especially after eating, pain in the chest or upper stomach, difficulty swallowing or dysphagia, and a lump-like sensation in the throat.

		Symptoms caused by GERD that make sufferers feel uncomfortable can be treated by taking medication and changing their lifestyle to be healthier. Apart from that, also avoid habits that cause GERD to recur, such as smoking, eating large amounts of food, consuming alcohol and coffee, and others.

		

		Forms of Self Care to Prevent GERD Recurrence 
		The key to preventing recurrence of GERD or stomach acid disease is in the hands of the sufferer. GERD sufferers can do self-care or take care of themselves, to prevent the recurrence of GERD symptoms that make them uncomfortable. For those of you who suffer from GERD, here are several forms of self-care that are recommended to be carried out.

		1. Avoid foods that trigger GERD symptoms
		As a GERD sufferer, you should know that there are certain foods and drinks that can trigger GERD symptoms. Therefore, if you want to prevent the symptoms from appearing again, the best thing you can do is not consume foods and drinks that trigger the symptoms.

		Foods and drinks that can trigger a recurrence of GERD symptoms include alcoholic drinks, foods containing acids such as oranges and tomatoes, coffee, spicy foods, fatty foods and fried foods. Start the habit of avoiding foods and drinks that trigger GERD slowly, so that a healthier lifestyle can be achieved.

		2. Consume food in small portions 
		GERD sufferers are recommended to consume food in small portions. If a person consumes large portions of food, it will take a long time for the stomach to empty. This length of time triggers greater pressure on the sphincter or muscle that locks the lower esophagus, and can trigger GERD symptoms.

		Instead of eating large portions of food, you can eat small portions of food more frequently. This way, the food intake you receive remains the same with large portions of food, but there will not be heavy pressure placed on the esophageal sphincter.

		3. Eat in a relaxed manner
		Did you know that eating under stress or in a hurry can trigger GERD symptoms? Therefore, try from now on to eat in a relaxed, aka calm, condition. Apart from being able to make you enjoy the food you eat more, eating in a relaxed manner will also prevent muscle tension which can trigger GERD symptoms.

		4. Sit up straight after eating
		You can prevent GERD recurrence by sitting upright and straight after eating. Considering that gravity can control reflux, sitting upright for several hours after eating will prevent the appearance of a burning sensation in the pit of the stomach or heartburn. This is also the reason why sleeping or lying down after eating is not recommended.

		5. Avoid certain activities after eating
		To prevent GERD from recurring, you are also advised to avoid physical activity after eating. The reason behind this recommendation is to avoid contraction of the abdominal muscles due to physical activity. These stomach contractions can force food back into the esophagus and trigger a burning sensation in the pit of the stomach.

		6. Quit Smoking
		The next way to prevent GERD from recurring is to stop smoking. Based on research, it was found that there is a relationship between smoking and GERD symptoms. The results showed that GERD symptoms subsided significantly in GERD sufferers who stopped smoking. Therefore, it is highly recommended for GERD sufferers to stop smoking.

		7. Avoid wearing tight clothes
		If you suffer from GERD, make it a habit from now on to avoid wearing tight clothing. Tight clothing will cause higher pressure on the stomach, so by avoiding it your stomach will feel more spacious. Loose clothing can be an option for those of you who suffer from GERD.

		8. Avoid sports that put pressure on the stomach
		Self-care to avoid recurrence of GERD can also be done by avoiding exercise that has the potential to increase pressure on the stomach. There are sports that can cause pressure on the stomach, such as sit ups, leg lifts and stomach crunches. Choose alternative sports that can minimize pressure on your stomach.

		Symptoms caused by GERD or stomach acid disease can trigger discomfort for sufferers. So that these symptoms can subside and also minimize the recurrence of these symptoms, you can follow several forms of self-care for GERD sufferers which are shared above.

		judul: "Be careful, this is the cause of kidney disease at a young age!",
		deskripsi: "Kidney disease can attack anyone, including young people. Find out the causes of kidney disease at a young age in this article.	",
		content: `
		The kidneys are a vital organ in the body whose function is vital. One of the main functions of the kidneys is to filter toxins and metabolic waste that are no longer needed by the body, to be excreted through urine. Now, imagine if this small body organ could not function properly. Of course, toxins in the body will accumulate and trigger health problems.

		Damage to the kidneys, which then causes kidney disease, is a condition that is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle at a young age. So, not only old people, young people are also at risk of developing kidney disease. So that kidney disease can be avoided, find out the causes of kidney disease below.

		1. Excessive consumption of pain relievers
		Habits that you think are trivial, such as taking painkillers, can actually be bad for your kidneys. Over-the-counter drugs such as NSAIDs and analgesics may be able to relieve the aches and pains you feel, but these drugs can damage your kidneys, especially if you have suffered from kidney disease before.

		If you are used to taking this painkiller regularly, try to reduce your consumption so that your kidneys can stay in top condition. Apart from that, never take more than the recommended dose on the drug label. This is what you can do to protect your kidneys.

		2. Consuming Excessive Protein 
		Protein is indeed an essential nutrient for the body. However, it's a different story if you consume it excessively. Excessive protein intake received by the body will make the kidneys work harder than usual, thereby risking triggering kidney problems. Therefore, adjust the protein consumed to the recommended intake.

		3. Excessive Salt Use 
		The next cause of kidney disease is excessive use of salt. Limit the amount of salt consumed, because consuming foods high in sodium can increase blood pressure and accelerate kidney damage. You can also experience kidney stones, which can cause nausea, extreme pain and difficulty urinating.

		Instead of using salt when cooking, you can choose other options such as using herbs or other spices that can replace the function of salt. If you get used to it, you will be able to easily avoid using excessive salt when cooking later.

		4. Not consuming enough water 
		Drinking enough water not only aims to hydrate the body, but also to maintain kidney health. If your body is well hydrated, it will help your kidneys to cleanse your body of sodium and toxins. Drinking enough water is also a way to avoid painful kidney stones.

		So that your risk of suffering from kidney disease at a young age does not increase, make it a habit to drink 1½ to 2 liters of water per day. The recommended amount of water may change depending on the activities you do, whether the fluid in your body drains quickly or not.

		5. Consuming processed foods
		Processed foods are known to be delicious, but behind that there is the potential for kidney damage that overshadows them. Processed foods are known to have very high sodium and phosphorus content. Based on several studies, high phosphorus intake from processed foods in people who do not have kidney disease will have a negative effect on the kidneys and bones.

		6. Staying up late 
		Avoid staying up late if you want your kidneys to avoid damage that causes kidney disease. Kidney function is regulated by the sleep cycle, which then helps coordinate the kidney's workload over a 24-hour period. Therefore, make sure you get enough sleep, at least 7 to 8 hours a day, so that your kidneys can be healthy and you will be fresh when you wake up.

		7. Smoking
		Smoking is one of the causes of this kidney disease. Not a few people suffer from kidney disease at a young age because of their smoking habit. Smoking will cause blood flow to the kidneys to slow down, and worsen high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, both of which are the main causes of kidney disease.

		8. Drink alcoholic drinks
		The habit of drinking alcoholic beverages has the potential to increase a person's risk of suffering from chronic kidney disease. Therefore, try to stop the habit of consuming alcoholic drinks from now on. Not only will the kidneys be healthy, but other important organs in the body will also remain in prime condition.

		9. Drink Fizzy Drinks 
		Apart from alcoholic drinks, fizzy drinks are also said to be one of the causes of kidney disease. If you drink 1 to 2 packs of diet soda a day, you will be more at risk of suffering from kidney disease. The bad effects that these fizzy drinks have on the kidneys are due to the sweeteners they contain.

		10. Excessive exercise
		Exercise is important, but don't do it too much. Excessive exercise or doing it for a long period of time can trigger rhabdomyolysis or a condition where damaged muscle tissue becomes destroyed in a short time. The remaining substances will later enter the blood, which will then injure the kidneys and cause kidney failure.

		These are some of the causes of kidney disease at a young age that you should avoid as much as possible. Take care of your kidneys as best as possible, remembering that the function of the kidneys is very crucial for the body, one of which is as a filter for toxins in the body. Healthy kidneys are one of the keys to a healthy body.

		deskripsi: "Smoking using regular cigarettes and electronic cigarettes both have their own dangers and side effects.",
		content: `
		Smoking using regular cigarettes and electronic cigarettes both have their own dangers and side effects. Although further research is still needed on e-cigarettes, the results of the latest studies now show that e-cigarettes are not a safer alternative to regular cigarettes.

		The dangers of smoking are most often related to heart disease. Therefore, quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do to maintain your health.

		In recent years, the development of electronic cigarettes has become a popular trend among young people. This trend can arise because of the many issues/opinions that say that e-cigarettes are safer, can help someone stop smoking, and so on.

		However, is this statement in accordance with the results of the latest health studies? In this article, we will discuss the risks and dangers of regular cigarettes vs electronic cigarettes.

		Regular vs electronic cigarettes, which is more dangerous?
		First of all, you need to know that smoking in any form does not provide positive health benefits. Based on current evidence, regular cigarettes are considered to contain more dangerous substances than e-cigarettes, but this does not mean that e-cigarettes are safe.

		Electronic cigarettes have various variations and shapes which generally use batteries, heating elements, and a container for vaping liquid. Electronic cigarettes are usually known as vapes, tanks, mods, pods, etc.

		The working principle is to heat a liquid containing nicotine (the result of tobacco extraction), flavorings and other chemicals to produce an aerosol (or sometimes called vapor) that can be inhaled.

		The dangers of electric smoking
		The study notes that someone who smokes a regular cigarette will inhale around 7,000 chemicals, while e-cigarettes (vaping) tend to involve fewer chemicals. The liquid from e-cigarettes does contain fewer contaminants than regular cigarettes, but studies also state that vaping is unsafe for the following reasons:

		Slows the development of brain cells. E-cigarettes use high doses of nicotine which can affect brain cells, especially in young users.

		The liquid from e-cigarettes is dangerous if swallowed or comes into contact with the skin

		Contains dangerous chemicals, such as diacetyl, carcinogens (cancer causes), heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

		Causes lung damage and inflammation. It was busy in 2020, this was mostly caused by modifications to e-cigarettes and/or the use of illegal liquids

		The addictive effect of nicotine. Regular use of certain doses of nicotine is highly addictive. It also causes high blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease

		Triggers the emergence of asthma and chronic lung disease

		E-cigarettes normalize smoking

		The dangers of ordinary cigarettes
		Because it is relatively new, the dangers of long-term smoking with e-cigarettes still require further research. However, long-term use of regular cigarettes has been studied for years and shows harmful results for our health, such as:

		Causes damage to various body organs (mouth, teeth, eyes, ears, heart, lungs, kidneys, etc.)

		Causes lung cancer and contributes to 90% of lung cancer deaths

		Causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes to 80% of COPD deaths

		Increases the risk of heart disease and stroke

		Lowers the body's immune system making it easy for infections to occur

		Improves the premature aging process

		The new generation is addicted to nicotine
		In recent years, the use of e-cigarettes among young teenagers has soared and is more popular than regular cigarettes. This is supported by data showing the use of e-cigarettes among middle and high school students. This probably happens because many teenagers believe that vaping is safer than regular cigarettes.

		On the other hand, electronic cigarettes are also increasingly popular because they are cheaper to use and the smoke they emit has various flavors and aromas. The impact of the increasing trend of e-cigarettes can trigger curiosity among teenagers who have never smoked and encourage the normalization of smoking habits in teenagers.

		E-cigarettes are effective in helping to quit smoking, is it true?
		The use of e-cigarettes as a tool to help stop smoking is currently not recommended. There is no strong evidence that shows the effectiveness of e-cigarettes in helping someone stop smoking.

		This is demonstrated by a study which found that the majority of adults who use e-cigarettes still use regular cigarettes as well (or what is known as "dual use").

		Someone who smokes using regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes regularly can cause serious health hazards. You should not use both products at the same time and it is highly recommended to completely stop using all tobacco products, both regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes.

		Health is very important. Therefore, we must try our best to provide maximum protection for ourselves. One effort you can make is to have Generali health insurance.

		Generali health insurance has a variety of products that you can adjust to your needs and conditions. When we have health insurance, we will be given protection from the various burdens we have to bear when we fall ill.
